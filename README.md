# dApp Portal for the Kansas Blockchain Fellowship

## Overview of Project
In addition to in-person classes and assignments, we've also build out some digital infrastruture to supplement the learning for the fellows in the program. Using token-gated digital identifiers (DIDs), fellows logged in and had interactive, responsive activities within the portal and, most importantly, the fellows were able to view their quiz and feedback.

## Quiz System
- The fellows would take weekly quizzes on paper and pencil.
- We would scan the quizzes, and grade with digital feedback.
- The digital feedback and the scanned version of the quiz would be encrypted and uploaded to decentralized filestorage on IPFS.
- The IPFS data would be tokenized, minted, and sent to each fellow's wallet.
